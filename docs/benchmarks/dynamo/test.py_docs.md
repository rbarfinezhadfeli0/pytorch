## Original Source

```py
import os
import unittest

from .common import parse_args, run
from .torchbench import setup_torchbench_cwd, TorchBenchmarkRunner


try:
    # fbcode only
    from aiplatform.utils.sanitizer_status import is_asan_or_tsan
except ImportError:

    def is_asan_or_tsan():
        return False


class TestDynamoBenchmark(unittest.TestCase):
    @unittest.skipIf(is_asan_or_tsan(), "ASAN/TSAN not supported")
    def test_benchmark_infra_runs(self) -> None:
        """
        Basic smoke test that TorchBench runs.

        This test is mainly meant to check that our setup in fbcode
        doesn't break.

        If you see a failure here related to missing CPP headers, then
        you likely need to update the resources list in:
            //caffe2:inductor
        """
        original_dir = setup_torchbench_cwd()
        try:
            args = parse_args(
                [
                    "-dcpu",
                    "--inductor",
                    "--training",
