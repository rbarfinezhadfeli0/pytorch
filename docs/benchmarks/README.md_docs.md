## File Metadata

- **Path**: `benchmarks/README.md`
- **Size**: 1,210 bytes (1.18 KB)
- **Type**: Markdown Documentation
- **Extension**: `.md`

## File Purpose

This file contains **examples or benchmarks**.

## Original Source

```markdown
# PyTorch Benchmarks

This folder contains scripts that produce reproducible timings of various PyTorch features.

It also provides mechanisms to compare PyTorch with other frameworks.

## Setup environment
Make sure you're on a machine with CUDA, torchvision, and pytorch installed. Install in the following order:
```
# Install torchvision. It comes with the pytorch stable release binary
python -m pip install torch torchvision

# Install the latest pytorch master from source.
# It should supersede the installation from the release binary.
cd $PYTORCH_HOME
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation -v -e .

# Check the pytorch installation version
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```
