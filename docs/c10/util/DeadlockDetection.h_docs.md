/// This file provides some simple utilities for detecting common deadlocks in
/// PyTorch.  For now, we focus exclusively on detecting Python GIL deadlocks,
/// as the GIL is a wide ranging lock that is taken out in many situations.
/// The basic strategy is before performing an operation that may block, you
/// can use TORCH_ASSERT_NO_GIL_WITHOUT_PYTHON_DEP() to assert that the GIL is
/// not held.  This macro is to be used in contexts where no static dependency
/// on Python is available (we will handle indirecting a virtual call for you).
///
/// If the GIL is held by a torchdeploy interpreter, we always report false.
/// If you are in a context where Python bindings are available, it's better
/// to directly assert on PyGILState_Check (as it avoids a vcall and also
/// works correctly with torchdeploy.)
