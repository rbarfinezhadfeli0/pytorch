 * A very simple Synchronization class for error-free use of data
 * in a multi-threaded context. See folly/docs/Synchronized.md for
 * the inspiration of this class.
 *
 * Full URL:
 * https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/docs/Synchronized.md
 *
 * This class implements a small subset of the generic functionality
 * implemented by folly:Synchronized<T>. Specifically, only withLock<T>
 * is implemented here since it's the smallest possible API that is
 * able to cover a large surface area of functionality offered by
 * folly::Synchronized<T>.
