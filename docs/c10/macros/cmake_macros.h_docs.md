# Documentation: `c10/macros/cmake_macros.h`

## File Metadata

- **Path**: `c10/macros/cmake_macros.h`
- **Size**: 287 bytes (0.28 KB)
- **Type**: C/C++ Header File
- **Extension**: `.h`

## File Purpose

This is a c/c++ header file that is part of the PyTorch project.

## Original Source

```c
// This file exists for backwards compatibility and has been moved to
// torch/headeronly/macros/cmake_macros.h.in. No end user library should be
// including this file directly anyway (cuz they should be including
// Macros.h instead).
#include <torch/headeronly/macros/cmake_macros.h>

```
