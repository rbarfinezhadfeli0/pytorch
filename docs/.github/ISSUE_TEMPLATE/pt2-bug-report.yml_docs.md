        #### Before submitting a bug, please make sure the issue hasn't been already addressed by searching through [the
        existing and past issues](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues)
        It's likely that your bug will be resolved by checking our FAQ or troubleshooting guide [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/dynamo/index.html)

        Note: if you're submitting an issue that you generated from a fuzzer. Please do the following:

        - Ensure rtol/atol are at default tolerances

        - Don't compare indices of max/min etc, because that avoids the above requirement

        - When comparing eager and torch.compile, use a higher precision result as a baseline. `torch._dynamo.utils.same` with fp64_ref will handle this comparison.

        - Ensure rng state used to compare results is equivalent. Use `torch._inductor.config.fallback_random=True` and reset the torch rng seed between comparisons

        If the above requirements are met, add the label "topic: fuzzer" to your issue.

        Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

        See https://pytorch.org/docs/main/torch.compiler_troubleshooting.html#reporting-issues
        for guidance on what to additionally include. In particular, consider including:

        - The `tlparse` for your program
        - Ablation - which `torch.compile` backend/mode/settings cause the bug
        - A minimal reproducer
