## Original Source

```h
/// Flush-To-Zero and Denormals-Are-Zero mode
///
/// Flush-To-Zero (FTZ) and Denormals-Are-Zero (DAZ) are modes that bypass
/// IEEE 754 methods of dealing with denormal floating-point numbers on x86-64
/// and some x86 CPUs. They result in reduced precision for values near zero,
/// but increased performance.
///
