#ifdef TORCH_ASSERT_NO_OPERATORS
#error This change adds a dependency on native_functions.yaml,             \
  meaning the file will need to be re-compiled every time an operator      \
  is changed or added. Consider if your change would be better placed in   \
  another file, or if a more specific header might achieve the same goal.  \
  See NOTE: [Tensor vs. TensorBase]

// Forward declarations of any types needed in the operator signatures.
// We can't directly include these classes because it will cause circular include dependencies.
// This file is included by TensorBody.h, which defines the Tensor class.
