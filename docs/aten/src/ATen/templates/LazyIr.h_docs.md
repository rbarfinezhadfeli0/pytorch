// kNullValue is used to contribute a static hash value any time
// a node has an Optional<Value> input that is nullopt.  It is important
// to differentiate between HASH(std::nullopt, something) and HASH(something, std::nullopt),
// and using kNullValue in the hash function in the order of arguments
// serves this purpose.
