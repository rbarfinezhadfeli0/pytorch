## Original Source

```cuh
// No "#pragma once" because this is a raw definition that can be copied by jit codegen.
// Eager mode clients should not include this file directly, instead,
// they should #include <ATen/cuda/PhiloxCudaState.h>, which has a #pragma once.

// Stores RNG state values. Passed as a kernel argument.
// See Note [CUDA Graph-safe RNG states].
//
// The raw definition lives in its own file so jit codegen can easily copy it.
