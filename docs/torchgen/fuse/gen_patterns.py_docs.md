import os

from torch._inductor import pattern_matcher
from torch._inductor.fx_passes import joint_graph


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start by deleting all the existing patterns.
    for path in pattern_matcher.SERIALIZED_PATTERN_PATH.iterdir():
        if path.name in {"__init__.py", "__pycache__"}:
            continue
        if path.is_file():
            path.unlink()

    # Now have joint_graph load all known patterns and tell the pattern matcher
    # to serialize the patterns as it goes.
    os.environ["PYTORCH_GEN_PATTERNS"] = "1"
