# Owner(s): ["module: bazel"]

"""
This test module contains a minimalistic "smoke tests" for the bazel build.

Currently it doesn't use any testing framework (i.e. pytest)
TODO: integrate this into the existing pytorch testing framework.

The name uses underscore `_test_bazel.py` to avoid globbing into other non-bazel configurations.
