## Original Source

```sh
#!/bin/bash
__doc__="
This script simply runs the torch doctests via the xdoctest runner.

This must be run from the root of the torch repo, as it needs the path to the
torch source code.

This script is provided as a developer convenience. On the CI the doctests are
invoked in 'run_test.py'
"
# To simply list tests
# xdoctest -m torch --style=google list

# Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/bash-script-dir

    # on things not intended to be doctests.
