"""
This is a test script that launches as part of the test cases in
run_test.py, to validate the correctness of
the method ``torch.distributed.is_torchelastic_launched()``. To do so,
we run this script with and without torchelastic and validate that the
boolean value written to the out_file is indeed what we expect (e.g.
should be False when not launched with torchelastic, True when launched with)
The script itself is not a test case hence no assertions are made in this script.
