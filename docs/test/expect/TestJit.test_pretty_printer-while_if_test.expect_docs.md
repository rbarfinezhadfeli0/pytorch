```expect
def while_if_test(a: Tensor,
    b: Tensor) -> Tensor:
  a0 = a
  c = 0
  b0 = b
  _0 = bool(torch.lt(a, 10))
  while _0:
    a1 = torch.add(a0, 1)
    b1 = torch.add(b0, 1)
    if bool(torch.gt(a1, b1)):
      c0 = 2
    else:
      c0 = 3
    _0, a0, c, b0 = bool(torch.lt(a1, 10)), a1, c0, b1
