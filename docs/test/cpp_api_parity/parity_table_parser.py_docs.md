## Original Source

```py
from collections import namedtuple


ParityStatus = namedtuple("ParityStatus", ["has_impl_parity", "has_doc_parity"])

"""
This function expects the parity tracker Markdown file to have the following format:

```
## package1_name

API | Implementation Parity | Doc Parity
------------- | ------------- | -------------
API_Name|No|No
...

## package2_name

API | Implementation Parity | Doc Parity
------------- | ------------- | -------------
API_Name|No|No
...
```

The returned dict has the following format:

```
Dict[package_name]
    -> Dict[api_name]
        -> ParityStatus
```
