## Original Source

```text
# automatically load the pytorch_lldb extension.
#
# lldb automatically tries to load this file whenever it is executed from the
# root of the pytorch repo, but by default it is not allowed to do so due to
# security reasons. If you want to use pytorch_lldb, please add the following
# line to your ~/.lldbinit (i.e., the .lldbinit file which is in your home
# directory, NOT this file):
#    settings set target.load-cwd-lldbinit true
#    setting set escape-non-printables false
#
# Alternatively, you can manually load the pytorch_lldb  commands into your
# existing lldb session by doing the following:
#    (lldb) command script import tools/lldb/pytorch_lldb.py

command script import tools/lldb/pytorch_lldb.py
setting set escape-non-printables false
type category enable torch

```
