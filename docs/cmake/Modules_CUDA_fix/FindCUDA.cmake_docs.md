# Documentation: `cmake/Modules_CUDA_fix/FindCUDA.cmake`

## File Metadata

- **Path**: `cmake/Modules_CUDA_fix/FindCUDA.cmake`
- **Size**: 459 bytes (0.45 KB)
- **Type**: CMake Build Script
- **Extension**: `.cmake`

## File Purpose

This is a cmake build script that is part of the PyTorch project.

## Original Source

```cmake
# This is a wrapper of the upstream `./upstream/FindCUDA.cmake` that
# automatically includes `./upstream/CMakeInitializeConfigs.cmake` before
# `./upstream/FindCUDA.cmake`. The `CMakeInitializeConfigs.cmake`, which is
# absent in old CMake versions, creates some necessary variables for the later
# to run.
# See ./README.md for details.

set(UPSTREAM_FIND_CUDA_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/upstream/")
