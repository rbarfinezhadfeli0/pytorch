## Original Source

```cmake
# Try to find the Gloo library and headers.
#  Gloo_FOUND        - system has Gloo lib
#  Gloo_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Gloo include directory
#  Gloo_NATIVE_LIBRARY - base gloo library, needs to be linked
#  Gloo_CUDA_LIBRARY/Gloo_HIP_LIBRARY - CUDA/HIP support library in Gloo

find_path(Gloo_INCLUDE_DIR
  NAMES gloo/common/common.h
  DOC "The directory where Gloo includes reside"
)

find_library(Gloo_NATIVE_LIBRARY
  NAMES gloo
  DOC "The Gloo library"
)

# Gloo has optional CUDA support
# if Gloo + CUDA is desired, Gloo_CUDA_LIBRARY
# needs to be linked into desired target

# Gloo has optional HIP support
# if Gloo + HIP is desired, Gloo_HIP_LIBRARY
# needs to be linked to desired target
