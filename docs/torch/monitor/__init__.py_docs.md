from torch._C._monitor import *  # noqa: F403
from torch._C._monitor import _WaitCounter, _WaitCounterTracker

    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

class TensorboardEventHandler:
    """
    TensorboardEventHandler is an event handler that will write known events to
    the provided SummaryWriter.

    This currently only supports ``torch.monitor.Stat`` events which are logged
    as scalars.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_MONITOR)
        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(module:tensorboard)
        >>> from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
        >>> from torch.monitor import TensorboardEventHandler, register_event_handler
        >>> writer = SummaryWriter("log_dir")
        >>> register_event_handler(TensorboardEventHandler(writer))
