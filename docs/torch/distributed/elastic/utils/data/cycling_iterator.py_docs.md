class CyclingIterator(Iterator[_T]):
    """
    An iterator decorator that cycles through the
    underlying iterator "n" times. Useful to "unroll"
    the dataset across multiple training epochs.

    The generator function is called as ``generator_fn(epoch)``
    to obtain the underlying iterator, where ``epoch`` is a
    number less than or equal to ``n`` representing the ``k``th cycle

    For example if ``generator_fn`` always returns ``[1,2,3]``
    then ``CyclingIterator(n=2, generator_fn)`` will iterate through
    ``[1,2,3,1,2,3]``
