## Original Source

import torch


__all__ = ["Dropout"]


class Dropout(torch.nn.Dropout):
    r"""This is the quantized equivalent of :class:`~torch.nn.Dropout`.
        And this is a placeholder to enable models where fp32 tensors
        had dropout to work with quantized tensors in train and eval mode.

    Args:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed
        inplace: can optionally do the operation in-place. Default: ``False``
    """

        return "QuantizedDropout"

    @classmethod
    def from_float(cls, mod, use_precomputed_fake_quant=False):
        return cls(mod.p, mod.inplace)

    @classmethod
