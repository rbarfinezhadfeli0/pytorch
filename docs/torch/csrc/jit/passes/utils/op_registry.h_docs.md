namespace torch::jit {
// Moved from shape_analysis.cpp

// Requirements:
//   dims           : preserved from the first argument
//   scalar type    : preserved from the first argument (doesn't have to
//                    match other arguments)
//   device         : always matching and preserved
//   tensor inputs  : *
//   tensor outputs : 1
// NB: those ops (with slight adjustments) are good candidates for restarts.
//     Knowing the type and device of weights or biases is usually enough to
//     infer the output type.

// Requirements:
