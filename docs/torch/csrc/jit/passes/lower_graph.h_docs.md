## Original Source

```h

#include <torch/csrc/jit/ir/ir.h>

namespace torch::jit {

using ModulePtr = c10::intrusive_ptr<c10::ivalue::Object>;

// Given a graph with of a method which first argument is %self, lower it to a
// graph where all attributes accesses are replaced with explicit inputs of the
// graph (rather than results of prim::GetAttr executed on %self).
//
// Returns a tuple (graph, parameters) where the last module.parameters.size()
// inputs to the graph are the trainable parameters used in this method. The
// remaining inputs are the true inputs to the function.

    Graph& graph,
