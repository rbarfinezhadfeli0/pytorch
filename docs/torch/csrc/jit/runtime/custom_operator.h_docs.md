/// `torch::jit::registerOperator` for every supplied operator, but allows doing
/// so in the global scope when a `RegisterOperators` object is assigned to a
/// static variable.
/// Note: This is *not* the custom operator API. If you want to register custom
/// operators, take a look at torch::RegisterOperators.

  /// The operator element is now optional to filter null ops. It's backward
  /// compatible and works for selective operator registration.
