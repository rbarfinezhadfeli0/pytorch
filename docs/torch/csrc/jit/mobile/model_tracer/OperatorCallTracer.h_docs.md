namespace torch::jit::mobile {
/* The OperatorCallTracer class handles the attachment and removal of a
 * recording callback that traces invocation of ATen (and other) PyTorch
 * operators that get called via the Dispatcher.
 *
 * You can get the set of operators that were called (op_name.overload_name)
 * using getCalledOperators().
 *
 * Note: This class is not thread safe or re-entrant, and should not be used
 * across multiple threads of execution.
