#include <torch/csrc/autograd/function.h>

namespace torch::distributed::autograd {

// As part of our distributed autograd implementation, whenever we send an RPC
// from one node to another, we add a 'SendRpcBackward' autograd function to the
// autograd graph. This is more or less a placeholder function that is used to
// kickoff the autograd engine on the current worker on the backward pass. The
// edges for this autograd function are the inputs to the RPC method.
//
// During the backward pass, this function is queued for execution in the
// autograd engine which eventually runs the rest of the autograd graph.
struct TORCH_API SendRpcBackward : public torch::autograd::Node {
 public:
  torch::autograd::variable_list apply(
      torch::autograd::variable_list&& inputs) override;

  // SendRpcBackward is actually the root of an autograd graph on the local
  // node. As a result, it doesn't receive any 'inputs', but rather the RPC
  // framework passes gradients over to this function to kickoff local autograd
  // computation.
  void setGrads(const torch::autograd::variable_list& grads);

  // Retrieve the grads for the function.
  const torch::autograd::variable_list& getGrads() const;

 private:
  torch::autograd::variable_list grads_;
};
