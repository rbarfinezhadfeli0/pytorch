// much easier to handle TensorLists in Lazy Tensor code if they are represented
// as a single Node so there can be more than one TensorList and more than one
// Tensor side-by-side as operands to an op.
//
// Note: shape is undefined for TensorList.  We assert in some places that
// #shapes matches #outputs and this stems from
//       the fact that currently all IR nodes represent tensors (there is no
//       type system for this IR).  Because of this, TensorList is a bit of a
//       hack.

// then implement it as NotImplemented for TensorList, also fixing the assertion
// that would fail.
