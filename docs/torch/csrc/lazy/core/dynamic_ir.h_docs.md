/**
 * The goal of "dynamic" Nodes is to patch a hole in our tracing.
 * Previously, if a user called `sizes` on a Tensor, it would leak out
 * of our tracing system, as `sizes` returns a torch.Size or an int. To
 * prevent this from happening, we introduce DimensionNode, a new type
 * of Node that abstracts the operation of getting the dimensions of a
 * Tensor.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 * ```
 * numel = x.shape()[0] * x.shape()[1]
 * ```
 *
 * Here, `x.shape()[i]` will be a SizeNode (subclass of DimensionNode),
 * and the multiplication of the two SizeNodes will be represented by
 * a SizeMul (also a subclass of DimensionNode). Through this, we can
 * prevent `numel` from being represented as a Python int and thus
 * burned into the Graph.
