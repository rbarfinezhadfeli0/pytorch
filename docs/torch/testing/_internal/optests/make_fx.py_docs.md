# Arguably we should make make_fx promote torch.Size() objects to symbolic shapes.
# Absent that, here is our strategy:
#
# If any argument is a torch.Size(), maybe get dynamic shapes for it by:
# - Create a temporary Tensor whose size is the torch.Size() we want. Note that
#   we use an expanded Tensor as we cannot pass "meta" Tensors to make_fx.
# - Pass it to make_fx such that it is converted to a proxy Tensor
# - Unpack the size in the wrapper to get a torch.Size with dynamic shapes (in
#   symbolic mode, a no-op otherwise)
