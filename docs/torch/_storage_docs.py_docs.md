from_file(filename, shared=False, nbytes=0) -> Storage

Creates a CPU storage backed by a memory-mapped file.

If ``shared`` is ``True``, then memory is shared between all processes.
All changes are written to the file. If ``shared`` is ``False``, then the changes on
the storage do not affect the file.

``nbytes`` is the number of bytes of storage. If ``shared`` is ``False``,
then the file must contain at least ``nbytes`` bytes. If ``shared`` is
``True`` the file will be created if needed. (Note that for ``UntypedStorage``
this argument differs from that of ``TypedStorage.from_file``)

Args:
    filename (str): file name to map
    shared (bool): whether to share memory (whether ``MAP_SHARED`` or ``MAP_PRIVATE`` is passed to the
                    underlying `mmap(2) call <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>`_)
    nbytes (int): number of bytes of storage
