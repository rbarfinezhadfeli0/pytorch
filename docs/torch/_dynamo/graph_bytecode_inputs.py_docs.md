# This file is to handle types that we don't want to support
# as explicit FX graph inputs. This uses a sidetable which
# we populate in bytecode and is loaded during graph execution

# We use a dynamo-generated index as a level of indirection
# this allows us to register objects externally in pre-graph bytecode that we want
# to pass to the graph, but not support their types as graph inputs
