```py

def pin_memory(data_ptr: int, size: int) -> None:
    cudart = torch.cuda.cudart()
    succ = int(
        cudart.cudaHostRegister(
            data_ptr,
            size,
            1,  # lines up with 'cudaHostRegisterPortable'
        )
    )

    if succ != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(
            f"Registering memory failed with cudaError: {succ}."
            " It's possible that this is an asynchronous error raised from a previous cuda operation."
            " Consider launching with CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 to debug."
        )


def unpin_memory(data_ptr: int) -> None:
    succ = int(torch.cuda.cudart().cudaHostUnregister(data_ptr))
    assert succ == 0, f"Unpinning shared memory failed with error-code: {succ}"
