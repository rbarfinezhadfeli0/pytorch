    broadcasting tensors of common batch shape but different rightmost shape,
    e.g. to broadcast mean vectors with covariance matrices.

def einsum(*args: Any) -> Tensor:
    r"""einsum(equation, *operands) -> Tensor

    Sums the product of the elements of the input :attr:`operands` along dimensions specified using a notation
    based on the Einstein summation convention.

    Einsum allows computing many common multi-dimensional linear algebraic array operations by representing them
    in a short-hand format based on the Einstein summation convention, given by :attr:`equation`. The details of
    this format are described below, but the general idea is to label every dimension of the input :attr:`operands`
    with some subscript and define which subscripts are part of the output. The output is then computed by summing
    the product of the elements of the :attr:`operands` along the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the
    output. For example, matrix multiplication can be computed using einsum as `torch.einsum("ij,jk->ik", A, B)`.
    Here, j is the summation subscript and i and k the output subscripts (see section below for more details on why).

    Equation:

        The :attr:`equation` string specifies the subscripts (letters in `[a-zA-Z]`) for each dimension of
        the input :attr:`operands` in the same order as the dimensions, separating subscripts for each operand by a
        comma (','), e.g. `'ij,jk'` specify subscripts for two 2D operands. The dimensions labeled with the same subscript
        must be broadcastable, that is, their size must either match or be `1`. The exception is if a subscript is
        repeated for the same input operand, in which case the dimensions labeled with this subscript for this operand
        must match in size and the operand will be replaced by its diagonal along these dimensions. The subscripts that
        appear exactly once in the :attr:`equation` will be part of the output, sorted in increasing alphabetical order.
        The output is computed by multiplying the input :attr:`operands` element-wise, with their dimensions aligned based
        on the subscripts, and then summing out the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the output.

        Optionally, the output subscripts can be explicitly defined by adding an arrow ('->') at the end of the equation
        followed by the subscripts for the output. For instance, the following equation computes the transpose of a
        matrix multiplication: 'ij,jk->ki'. The output subscripts must appear at least once for some input operand and
        at most once for the output.

        Ellipsis ('...') can be used in place of subscripts to broadcast the dimensions covered by the ellipsis.
        Each input operand may contain at most one ellipsis which will cover the dimensions not covered by subscripts,
        e.g. for an input operand with 5 dimensions, the ellipsis in the equation `'ab...c'` cover the third and fourth
        dimensions. The ellipsis does not need to cover the same number of dimensions across the :attr:`operands` but the
        'shape' of the ellipsis (the size of the dimensions covered by them) must broadcast together. If the output is not
        explicitly defined with the arrow ('->') notation, the ellipsis will come first in the output (left-most dimensions),
        before the subscript labels that appear exactly once for the input operands. e.g. the following equation implements
        batch matrix multiplication `'...ij,...jk'`.

        A few final notes: the equation may contain whitespaces between the different elements (subscripts, ellipsis,
        arrow and comma) but something like `'. . .'` is not valid. An empty string `''` is valid for scalar operands.

    .. note::

        ``torch.einsum`` handles ellipsis ('...') differently from NumPy in that it allows dimensions
        covered by the ellipsis to be summed over, that is, ellipsis are not required to be part of the output.

    .. note::

        Please install opt-einsum (https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in order to enroll into a more
        performant einsum. You can install when installing torch like so: `pip install torch[opt-einsum]` or by itself
        with `pip install opt-einsum`.

        If opt-einsum is available, this function will automatically speed up computation and/or consume less memory
        by optimizing contraction order through our opt_einsum backend :mod:`torch.backends.opt_einsum` (The _ vs - is
        confusing, I know). This optimization occurs when there are at least three inputs, since the order does not matter
        otherwise. Note that finding `the` optimal path is an NP-hard problem, thus, opt-einsum relies on different
        heuristics to achieve near-optimal results. If opt-einsum is not available, the default order is to contract
        from left to right.

        To bypass this default behavior, add the following to disable opt_einsum and skip path calculation:
        ``torch.backends.opt_einsum.enabled = False``

        To specify which strategy you'd like for opt_einsum to compute the contraction path, add the following line:
        ``torch.backends.opt_einsum.strategy = 'auto'``. The default strategy is 'auto', and we also support 'greedy' and
        'optimal'. Disclaimer that the runtime of 'optimal' is factorial in the number of inputs! See more details in
        the opt_einsum documentation (https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/path_finding.html).

    .. note::

        As of PyTorch 1.10 :func:`torch.einsum` also supports the sublist format (see examples below). In this format,
        subscripts for each operand are specified by sublists, list of integers in the range [0, 52). These sublists
        follow their operands, and an extra sublist can appear at the end of the input to specify the output's
        subscripts., e.g. `torch.einsum(op1, sublist1, op2, sublist2, ..., [subslist_out])`. Python's `Ellipsis` object
        may be provided in a sublist to enable broadcasting as described in the Equation section above.

    Args:
        equation (str): The subscripts for the Einstein summation.
        operands (List[Tensor]): The tensors to compute the Einstein summation of.

        This is helpful when you want to visualize data over some
        range of inputs. See below for a plotting example.

        Given :math:`N` 1D tensors :math:`T_0 \ldots T_{N-1}` as
        inputs with corresponding sizes :math:`S_0 \ldots S_{N-1}`,
        this creates :math:`N` N-dimensional tensors :math:`G_0 \ldots
        G_{N-1}`, each with shape :math:`(S_0, ..., S_{N-1})` where
        the output :math:`G_i` is constructed by expanding :math:`T_i`
        to the result shape.

        .. note::
            0D inputs are treated equivalently to 1D inputs of a
            single element.

        .. warning::
            `torch.meshgrid(*tensors)` currently has the same behavior
            as calling `numpy.meshgrid(*arrays, indexing='ij')`.

            In the future `torch.meshgrid` will transition to
            `indexing='xy'` as the default.

            https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/50276 tracks
            this issue with the goal of migrating to NumPy's behavior.

        .. seealso::

            :func:`torch.cartesian_prod` has the same effect but it
            collects the data in a tensor of vectors.

        Args:
            tensors (list of Tensor): list of scalars or 1 dimensional tensors. Scalars will be
                treated as tensors of size :math:`(1,)` automatically

            indexing: (str, optional): the indexing mode, either "xy"
                or "ij", defaults to "ij". See warning for future changes.

                If "xy" is selected, the first dimension corresponds
                to the cardinality of the second input and the second
                dimension corresponds to the cardinality of the first
                input.

                If "ij" is selected, the dimensions are in the same
                order as the cardinality of the inputs.

        Returns:
            seq (sequence of Tensors): If the input has :math:`N`
            tensors of size :math:`S_0 \ldots S_{N-1}``, then the
            output will also have :math:`N` tensors, where each tensor
            is of shape :math:`(S_0, ..., S_{N-1})`.

    .. warning::
        From version 1.8.0, :attr:`return_complex` must always be given
        explicitly for real inputs and `return_complex=False` has been
        deprecated. Strongly prefer `return_complex=True` as in a future
        pytorch release, this function will only return complex tensors.

        Note that :func:`torch.view_as_real` can be used to recover a real
        tensor with an extra last dimension for real and imaginary components.

    .. warning::
        From version 2.1, a warning will be provided if a :attr:`window` is
        not specified. In a future release, this attribute will be required.
        Not providing a window currently defaults to using a rectangular window,
        which may result in undesirable artifacts. Consider using tapered windows,
        such as :func:`torch.hann_window`.

    The STFT computes the Fourier transform of short overlapping windows of the
    input. This giving frequency components of the signal as they change over
    time. The interface of this function is modeled after (but *not* a drop-in
    replacement for) librosa_ stft function.

    .. _librosa: https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.stft.html

    Ignoring the optional batch dimension, this method computes the following
    expression:

    .. math::
        X[\omega, m] = \sum_{k = 0}^{\text{win\_length-1}}%
                            \text{window}[k]\ \text{input}[m \times \text{hop\_length} + k]\ %
                            \exp\left(- j \frac{2 \pi \cdot \omega k}{\text{n\_fft}}\right),

    where :math:`m` is the index of the sliding window, and :math:`\omega` is
    the frequency :math:`0 \leq \omega < \text{n\_fft}` for ``onesided=False``,
    or :math:`0 \leq \omega < \lfloor \text{n\_fft} / 2 \rfloor + 1` for ``onesided=True``.

    * :attr:`input` must be either a 1-D time sequence or a 2-D batch of time
      sequences.

    * If :attr:`hop_length` is ``None`` (default), it is treated as equal to
      ``floor(n_fft / 4)``.

    * If :attr:`win_length` is ``None`` (default), it is treated as equal to
      :attr:`n_fft`.

    * :attr:`window` can be a 1-D tensor of size :attr:`win_length`, e.g., from
      :meth:`torch.hann_window`. If :attr:`window` is ``None`` (default), it is
      treated as if having :math:`1` everywhere in the window. If
      :math:`\text{win\_length} < \text{n\_fft}`, :attr:`window` will be padded on
      both sides to length :attr:`n_fft` before being applied.

    * If :attr:`center` is ``True`` (default), :attr:`input` will be padded on
      both sides so that the :math:`t`-th frame is centered at time
      :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`. Otherwise, the :math:`t`-th frame
      begins at time  :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`.

    * :attr:`pad_mode` determines the padding method used on :attr:`input` when
      :attr:`center` is ``True``. See :meth:`torch.nn.functional.pad` for
      all available options. Default is ``"reflect"``.

    * If :attr:`onesided` is ``True`` (default for real input), only values for
      :math:`\omega` in :math:`\left[0, 1, 2, \dots, \left\lfloor
      \frac{\text{n\_fft}}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\right]` are returned because
      the real-to-complex Fourier transform satisfies the conjugate symmetry,
      i.e., :math:`X[m, \omega] = X[m, \text{n\_fft} - \omega]^*`.
      Note if the input or window tensors are complex, then :attr:`onesided`
      output is not possible.

    * If :attr:`normalized` is ``True`` (default is ``False``), the function
      returns the normalized STFT results, i.e., multiplied by :math:`(\text{frame\_length})^{-0.5}`.

    * If :attr:`return_complex` is ``True`` (default if input is complex), the
      return is a ``input.dim() + 1`` dimensional complex tensor. If ``False``,
      the output is a ``input.dim() + 2`` dimensional real tensor where the last
      dimension represents the real and imaginary components.

    Returns either a complex tensor of size :math:`(* \times N \times T)` if
    :attr:`return_complex` is true, or a real tensor of size :math:`(* \times N
    \times T \times 2)`. Where :math:`*` is the optional batch size of
    :attr:`input`, :math:`N` is the number of frequencies where STFT is applied
    and :math:`T` is the total number of frames used.

      This function changed signature at version 0.4.1. Calling with the
      previous signature may cause error or return incorrect result.

            Default: ``None`` (treated as window of all :math:`1` s)
        center (bool, optional): whether to pad :attr:`input` on both sides so
            that the :math:`t`-th frame is centered at time :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`.
            Default: ``True``
        pad_mode (str, optional): controls the padding method used when
            :attr:`center` is ``True``. Default: ``"reflect"``
        normalized (bool, optional): controls whether to return the normalized STFT results
             Default: ``False``
        onesided (bool, optional): controls whether to return half of results to
            avoid redundancy for real inputs.
            Default: ``True`` for real :attr:`input` and :attr:`window`, ``False`` otherwise.
        return_complex (bool, optional): whether to return a complex tensor, or
            a real tensor with an extra last dimension for the real and
            imaginary components.

            .. versionchanged:: 2.0
               ``return_complex`` is now a required argument for real inputs,
               as the default is being transitioned to ``True``.

            .. deprecated:: 2.0
               ``return_complex=False`` is deprecated, instead use ``return_complex=True``
               Note that calling :func:`torch.view_as_real` on the output will
               recover the deprecated output format.

    Returns:
        Tensor: A tensor containing the STFT result with shape `(B?, N, T, C?)` where
           - `B?` is an optional batch dimension from the input.
           - `N` is the number of frequency samples, `(n_fft // 2) + 1` for
             `onesided=True`, or otherwise `n_fft`.
           - `T` is the number of frames, `1 + L // hop_length`
             for `center=True`, or `1 + (L - n_fft) // hop_length` otherwise.
           - `C?` is an optional length-2 dimension of real and imaginary
             components, present when `return_complex=False`.

Inverse short time Fourier Transform. This is expected to be the inverse of :func:`~torch.stft`.

.. warning::
    From version 2.1, a warning will be provided if a :attr:`window` is
    not specified. In a future release, this attribute will be required.
    Please provide the same window used in the stft call.

It has the same parameters (+ additional optional parameter of :attr:`length`) and it should return the
least squares estimation of the original signal. The algorithm will check using the NOLA condition (
nonzero overlap).

Important consideration in the parameters :attr:`window` and :attr:`center` so that the envelope
created by the summation of all the windows is never zero at certain point in time. Specifically,
:math:`\sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} |w|^2[n-t\times hop\_length] \cancel{=} 0`.

Since :func:`~torch.stft` discards elements at the end of the signal if they do not fit in a frame,
``istft`` may return a shorter signal than the original signal (can occur if :attr:`center` is False
since the signal isn't padded). If `length` is given in the arguments and is longer than expected,
``istft`` will pad zeros to the end of the returned signal.

If :attr:`center` is ``True``, then there will be padding e.g. ``'constant'``, ``'reflect'``, etc.
Left padding can be trimmed off exactly because they can be calculated but right padding cannot be
calculated without additional information.

Example: Suppose the last window is:
``[17, 18, 0, 0, 0]`` vs ``[18, 0, 0, 0, 0]``

The :attr:`n_fft`, :attr:`hop_length`, :attr:`win_length` are all the same which prevents the calculation
of right padding. These additional values could be zeros or a reflection of the signal so providing
:attr:`length` could be useful. If :attr:`length` is ``None`` then padding will be aggressively removed
(some loss of signal).

        - `N` is the number of frequency samples, `(n_fft // 2) + 1`
          for onesided input, or otherwise `n_fft`.
        - `T` is the number of frames, `1 + length // hop_length` for centered stft,
          or `1 + (length - n_fft) // hop_length` otherwise.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Real datatype inputs are no longer supported. Input must now have a
            complex datatype, as returned by ``stft(..., return_complex=True)``.
    n_fft (int): Size of Fourier transform
    hop_length (Optional[int]): The distance between neighboring sliding window frames.
        (Default: ``n_fft // 4``)
    win_length (Optional[int]): The size of window frame and STFT filter. (Default: ``n_fft``)
    window (Optional[torch.Tensor]): The optional window function.
        Shape must be 1d and `<= n_fft`
        (Default: ``torch.ones(win_length)``)
    center (bool): Whether :attr:`input` was padded on both sides so that the :math:`t`-th frame is
        centered at time :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`.
        (Default: ``True``)
    normalized (bool): Whether the STFT was normalized. (Default: ``False``)
    onesided (Optional[bool]): Whether the STFT was onesided.
        (Default: ``True`` if `n_fft != fft_size` in the input size)
    length (Optional[int]): The amount to trim the signal by (i.e. the
        original signal length). Defaults to `(T - 1) * hop_length` for
        centered stft, or `n_fft + (T - 1) * hop_length` otherwise, where `T`
        is the number of input frames.
    return_complex (Optional[bool]):
        Whether the output should be complex, or if the input should be
        assumed to derive from a real signal and window.
        Note that this is incompatible with ``onesided=True``.
        (Default: ``False``)

    Returns the unique elements of the input tensor.

    .. note:: This function is different from :func:`torch.unique_consecutive` in the sense that
        this function also eliminates non-consecutive duplicate values.

    .. note:: Currently in the CUDA implementation and the CPU implementation,
        `torch.unique` always sort the tensor at the beginning regardless of the `sort` argument.
        Sorting could be slow, so if your input tensor is already sorted, it is recommended to use
        :func:`torch.unique_consecutive` which avoids the sorting.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor
        sorted (bool): Whether to sort the unique elements in ascending order
            before returning as output.
        return_inverse (bool): Whether to also return the indices for where
            elements in the original input ended up in the returned unique list.
        return_counts (bool): Whether to also return the counts for each unique
            element.
        dim (int, optional): the dimension to operate upon. If ``None``, the
            unique of the flattened input is returned. Otherwise, each of the
            tensors indexed by the given dimension is treated as one of the
            elements to apply the unique operation upon. See examples for more
            details. Default: ``None``

    Returns:
        (Tensor, Tensor (optional), Tensor (optional)): A tensor or a tuple of tensors containing

            - **output** (*Tensor*): the output list of unique scalar elements.
            - **inverse_indices** (*Tensor*): (optional) if

              for where elements in the original input map to in the output;
              otherwise, this function will only return a single tensor.
            - **counts** (*Tensor*): (optional) if
              :attr:`return_counts` is True, there will be an additional
              returned tensor (same shape as output or output.size(dim),

    .. note:: This function is different from :func:`torch.unique` in the sense that this function
        only eliminates consecutive duplicate values. This semantics is similar to `std::unique`
        in C++.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor
        return_inverse (bool): Whether to also return the indices for where
            elements in the original input ended up in the returned unique list.
        return_counts (bool): Whether to also return the counts for each unique
            element.
        dim (int): the dimension to apply unique. If ``None``, the unique of the
            flattened input is returned. default: ``None``

    Returns:
        (Tensor, Tensor (optional), Tensor (optional)): A tensor or a tuple of tensors containing

            - **output** (*Tensor*): the output list of unique scalar elements.
            - **inverse_indices** (*Tensor*): (optional) if

              returned tensor (same shape as input) representing the indices
              for where elements in the original input map to in the output;
              otherwise, this function will only return a single tensor.
            - **counts** (*Tensor*): (optional) if
              :attr:`return_counts` is True, there will be an additional
              returned tensor (same shape as output or output.size(dim),
