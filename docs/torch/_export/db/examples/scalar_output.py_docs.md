dim1_x = Dim("dim1_x")

class ScalarOutput(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Returning scalar values from the graph is supported, in addition to Tensor
    outputs. Symbolic shapes are captured and rank is specialized.

        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
        return x.shape[1] + 1
