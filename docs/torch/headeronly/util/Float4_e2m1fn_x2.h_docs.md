/// Defines the Float4_e2m1fn_x2 type (4-bit floating-point, two elements packed
/// into one byte). This is the FP4 dtype from the OCP MX format spec
/// (https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-microscaling-formats-mx-v1-0-spec-final-pdf,
/// Section 5.3.3)
///
/// Given two high precision values val0 and val1, here is the
/// binary configuration of their packed representation, from MSB to LSB:
///
///   original value             | val1 : val0
///   ========================================
///   bit index (MSB==7, LSB==0) | 7654 : 3210
///   sign/exponent/mantissa     | seem : seem
