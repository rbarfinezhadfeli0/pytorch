"""Constants for annotations in the mapping.

The constants defined here are used to annotate the mapping tuples in cuda_to_hip_mappings.py.
They are based on
https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/blob/master/src/Statistics.h
and fall in three categories: 1) type of mapping, 2) API of mapping, 3) unsupported
mapping.
