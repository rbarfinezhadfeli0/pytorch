## Original Source

```py
from collections.abc import Callable
from typing import Generic, TypeVar


R = TypeVar("R")


class Thunk(Generic[R]):
    """
    A simple lazy evaluation implementation that lets you delay
    execution of a function.  It properly handles releasing the
    function once it is forced.
    """

    f: Callable[[], R] | None
    r: R | None

    __slots__ = ["f", "r"]

    def __init__(self, f: Callable[[], R]) -> None:
        self.f = f
