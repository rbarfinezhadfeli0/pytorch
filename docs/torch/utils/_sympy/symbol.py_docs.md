"""
This file contains canonical definitions for our symbol naming conventions,
across torch.fx.experimental.symbolic_shapes and torch._inductor.  The
intention is:

1. To make it easily greppable where all the sites we use a prefix are
2. Make it possible to easily tell if we can introduce a new prefix without
   introducing a conflict

You can occasionally test if prefixes have been hardcoded by renaming prefixes
in this file and seeing what breaks.
