    r"""Returns if a top-level module with :attr:`name` exists *without**
    importing it. This is generally safer than try-catch block around a
    `import X`. It avoids third party libraries breaking assumptions of some of
    our tests, e.g., setting multiprocessing start method when imported
    (see librosa/#747, torchvision/#544).

    import dill

    # XXX: By default, dill writes the Pickler dispatch table to inject its
    # own logic there. This globally affects the behavior of the standard library
    # pickler for any user who transitively depends on this module!
    # Undo this extension to avoid altering the behavior of the pickler globally.
