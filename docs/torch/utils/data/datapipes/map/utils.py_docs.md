```py
import copy

from typing import Any, TypeVar

from torch.utils.data.datapipes.datapipe import MapDataPipe


_T = TypeVar("_T")

__all__ = ["SequenceWrapperMapDataPipe"]


class SequenceWrapperMapDataPipe(MapDataPipe[_T]):
    r"""
    Wraps a sequence object into a MapDataPipe.

    Args:
        sequence: Sequence object to be wrapped into an MapDataPipe
        deepcopy: Option to deepcopy input sequence object

    .. note::
      If ``deepcopy`` is set to False explicitly, users should ensure
      that data pipeline doesn't contain any in-place operations over
      the iterable instance, in order to prevent data inconsistency
      across iterations.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> from torchdata.datapipes.map import SequenceWrapper
        >>> dp = SequenceWrapper(range(10))
        >>> list(dp)
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        >>> dp = SequenceWrapper({"a": 100, "b": 200, "c": 300, "d": 400})
        >>> dp["a"]
        100
