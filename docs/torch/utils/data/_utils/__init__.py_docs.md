r"""Utility classes & functions for data loading. Code in this folder is mostly used by ../dataloder.py.

A lot of multiprocessing is used in data loading, which only supports running
functions defined in global environment (py2 can't serialize static methods).
Therefore, for code tidiness we put these functions into different files in this
folder.

r"""Interval (in seconds) to check status of processes to avoid hanging in
    multiprocessing data loading. This is mainly used in getting data from

the Python core library resources are freed, but Python may already be exiting
for some time when this is set.

Hook to set this flag is `_set_python_exit_flag`, and is inspired by a similar
hook in Python 3.7 multiprocessing library:
