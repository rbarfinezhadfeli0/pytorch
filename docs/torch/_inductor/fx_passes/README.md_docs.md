# Implicit Invariants for writing FX Graph Passes
## Fake Tensor metadata on node
Each FX node has metadata on it, and in particular, stores a faketensor representing the metadata of that node `node.meta['val']`. This FakeTensor has properties like 1. shape, 2. stride, and 3. aliasing information. However, various passes may change the faketensor values, and so we need to maintain consistency.

The current way we do this is through FakeTensorUpdater (in _inductor/fx_utils.py). Read it for more details, and run it if your pass needs accurate faketensor metadata.

## Mutations throughout the stack
The invariant about mutation we have is:

**After AOTDispatch tracing and before Inductor, we have no mutation in our graph, except for a copy_ epilogue at the end of the graph.**

For example, passes operating on the joint_graph and post_grad graph do not need to worry about mutation at all.

However, we do still have aliasing in the graph. This does not matter most of the time, but it does mean that **our passes are not allowed to cause any additional inputs/outputs to alias if they did not alias in the original graph**.

For example
```python
def f(x: Tensor):
    return x.clone()
```
cannot be turned into a no-op, as this would change the semantics of the compiled graph.

In addition, AOTDispatch can introduce a copy_ epilogue into the graph. For example, we may have a graph like
```python
def f(x: Tensor):
    y = x.clone()
    x.copy_(y)
    return y
```
In this case, we are also not allowed to eliminate `x.clone()`. Luckily, the
condition for when this can cause problems is the same as with aliasing,
which is that **our passes are not allowed to cause the input and output to
alias if they did not alias in the original graph**. To check whether the
inputs and outputs have any aliasing, it suffices to check whether the
storages of the input and the storages of the output have any overlap. See
`remove_noop_ops` for an example of how to do this.

Additionally, we do have one pass that *does* introduce mutation - `reinplace_inplaceable_ops`. This pass must run *just before Inductor lowering*, as otherwise this breaks our invariant.
