from typing import Optional


_IN_TOPLEVEL_PROCESS = True


def in_toplevel_process() -> bool:
    global _IN_TOPLEVEL_PROCESS
    return _IN_TOPLEVEL_PROCESS


# If this process dies abnormally (e.g. segfault)
# it will not shut down the workers. Instead,
# the workers will have their parent reassigned to the
# init process. This launches a separate thread to
# watch for the worker getting reassigned,
# and cleans it up in this case.
#
# This function cannot be an inner function since otherwise mp_context="spawn" would
# not work for ProcessPoolExecutor since inner functions cannot be pickled.
