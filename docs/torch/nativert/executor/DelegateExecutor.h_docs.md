  // Runtime calls processWeights() to pass the weights to the delegate backend.
  // Typically, a backend would perform some form of validation and processing,
  // such as constant folding. The processed weights stays in the deactivate
  // state until commitWeights() is called.
  //
  // Weights tensors are co-owned by the runtime and the delegate backend.
  // In the regular inference run() path, neither Runtime or Delegate backend
  // can modify the weights tensor.
  // To support inplace weight update, weight tensors are be exposed by
  // ModelRunner::getWeights() to an external caller. The external caller can
  // then modify the weight tensors in-place. Such mutation would instantly
  // affect the weight tensors in the delegate backend.
  // When a weight tensor is no longer used by the delegate backend, the backend
  // must release it by decreasing a refcount. Runtime would
  // also release the refcount for weight tensor if it's no longer activate. The
  // underlying storage for weight tensors will be freed when the refcount
  // reaches 0.
