You are using mypy version {version}, which is not supported
in the PyTorch repo. Please switch to mypy version {correct_version}.

For example, if you installed mypy via pip, run this:

    pip install mypy=={correct_version}

Or if you installed mypy via conda, run this:

    conda install -c conda-forge mypy={correct_version}
