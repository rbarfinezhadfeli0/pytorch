# Working with `fullgraph=False`
While `fullgraph=False` is the default `torch.compile` setting, the semantics of resuming compilation upon encountering a graph break are more complicated.
You can find details on the `fullgraph=False` semantics in the subsections.

The strategy for using `torch.compile(fullgraph=False)` is as follows:

1. [Determine the ideal location to place `torch.compile`](programming_model.where_to_apply_compile). Normally, it is the highest-level function that doesn’t result in excessive graph breaks.
   Functions that do a lot of preprocessing or I/O operations are examples of functions that result in many graph breaks and do not significantly benefit from `torch.compile`.
   a. You can isolate issues by first compiling individual functions/modules before compiling entire models.
2. [Apply `torch.compiler.disable` to functions in the compiled region that result in a lot of graph breaks
   and do not benefit from compilation](programming_model.compiler_disable). In this case, one graph break is better than potentially tens or hundreds.
3. [Use `TORCH_LOGS="graph_breaks"` or tlparse to investigate remaining graph breaks.](programming_model.observability)
   Work around these graph breaks using the same approaches as working around graph breaks under
   the `fullgraph=True` programming model. Not all graph breaks need to be removed - some may
   impact performance more than others. The general rule is to focus on graph breaks that are happening during model computation.
   a. We recommend using `torch.compile(backend='eager')` when debugging graph breaks, for faster debugging iteration times
