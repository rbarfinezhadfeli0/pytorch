    # missing-field-parameters has both a large number of violations
    # in the codebase, but it also is used pervasively in the Python C
    # API. There are a couple of catches though:
    # * we use multiple versions of the Python API and hence have
    #   potentially multiple different versions of each relevant
    #   struct. They may have different numbers of fields. It will be
    #   unwieldy to support multiple versions in the same source file.
    # * Python itself for many of these structs recommends only
    #   initializing a subset of the fields. We should respect the API
    #   usage conventions of our dependencies.
    #
    # Hence, we just disable this warning altogether. We may want to
    # clean up some of the clear-cut cases that could be risky, but we
    # still likely want to have this disabled for the most part.
