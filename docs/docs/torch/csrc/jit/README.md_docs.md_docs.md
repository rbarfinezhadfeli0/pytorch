# PyTorch JIT

This folder contains (most of) the C++ code for the PyTorch JIT, a language
and compiler stack for executing PyTorch models portably and efficiently. To
learn more about the JIT from a user perspective, please consult our
[reference documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) and
[tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html).

A brief summary of the source tree:
- [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md): High-level technical overview of the JIT.
- [frontend/](frontend): Taking PyTorch modules in Python and translating them into the
  JIT IR.
- [ir/](ir): Core IR abstractions.
- [runtime/](runtime): Interpreter, graph execution, and JIT operators.
- [codegen/](codegen): Generating efficient, hardware-specific code for JIT subgraphs.
- [serialization/](serialization): Saving and loading modules.
- [api/](api): Any user-facing C++ or Python interfaces.
- [python/](python): Binding stuff into Python or accessing information from the Python
  environment.
- [testing/](testing): Utilities and helpers for testing.
- [mobile/](mobile): Mobile-specific implementations of runtime components.
- [passes/](passes): IR-to-IR passes, generally for optimization and lowering.
- [generated/](generated): This folder is generated by the PyTorch build, and contains
  bindings for native PyTorch operators into the JIT.

**Refer** to each folder for more in-depth documentation.

Other relevant parts of the codebase not contained here:
- [aten/src/ATen/core](../../../aten/src/ATen/core): contains JIT code reused by other elements of the
  runtime system (eager, mobile, etc.)
