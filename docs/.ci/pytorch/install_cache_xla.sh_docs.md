# Script for installing sccache on the xla build job, which uses xla's docker
# image, which has sccache installed but doesn't write the stubs.  This is
# mostly copied from .ci/docker/install_cache.sh.  Changes are: removing checks
# that will always return the same thing, ex checks for for rocm, CUDA, changing
# the path where sccache is installed, not changing /etc/environment, and not
# installing/downloading sccache as it is already in the docker image.
