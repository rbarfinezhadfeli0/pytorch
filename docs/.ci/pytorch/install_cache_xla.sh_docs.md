## File Metadata

- **Path**: `.ci/pytorch/install_cache_xla.sh`
- **Size**: 1,676 bytes (1.64 KB)
- **Type**: Shell Script
- **Extension**: `.sh`

## File Purpose

This is a shell script that is part of the PyTorch project.

## Original Source

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script for installing sccache on the xla build job, which uses xla's docker
# image, which has sccache installed but doesn't write the stubs.  This is
# mostly copied from .ci/docker/install_cache.sh.  Changes are: removing checks
# that will always return the same thing, ex checks for for rocm, CUDA, changing
# the path where sccache is installed, not changing /etc/environment, and not
# installing/downloading sccache as it is already in the docker image.

set -ex -o pipefail

mkdir -p /tmp/cache/bin
export PATH="/tmp/cache/bin:$PATH"

  # https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90589
  if [ "$1" == "gcc" ]; then
    # Do not call sccache recursively when dumping preprocessor argument
    # For some reason it's very important for the first cached nvcc invocation
    cat >"/tmp/cache/bin/$1" <<EOF
#!/bin/sh

# sccache does not support -E flag, so we need to call the original compiler directly in order to avoid calling this wrapper recursively
