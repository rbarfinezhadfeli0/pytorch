"""
This coverage plug-in attempts to cover JIT'd functions and methods that were previously missed in code coverage. Any
function and method that was passed through/decorated with torch.jit.script or torch.jit.script_method should now be
marked covered when coverage is run with this plug-in.

DISCLAIMER: note that this will mark the entire JIT'd function/method as covered without seeking proof that the
compiled code has been executed. This means that even if the code chunk is merely compiled and not run, it will get
marked as covered.
