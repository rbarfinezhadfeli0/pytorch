// NOTE [Sharded File]: on this file's split-into-shards state
//
// Back in the good old days, VariableType.cpp was generated as one
// file with every function in it, and everything was great and
// simple.
//
// However, this file was also very large (over 36,000 lines), and
// compiling it was very slow, and in fact was a significant
// bottleneck for incremental rebuilds. To address this, we now
// generate the file split across multiple shards, named
// VariableType_0.cpp and so on, which can be compiled in parallel.
//
// For ease of inspection and debugging, so that it's not necessary to
// go rooting around in multiple files, we also generate all the
// functions together in VariableTypeEverything.cpp. This generated
// file is only for convenience; it's not actually used in the
// build. If the file you're looking at now is one of the shards, you
// may want to switch over to the Everything variant to make you
// grepping smoother.
