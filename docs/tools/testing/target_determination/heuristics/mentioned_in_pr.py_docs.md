# This heuristic searches the PR body and commit titles, as well as issues/PRs
# mentioned in the PR body/commit title for test names (search depth of 1) and
# gives the test a rating of 1.  For example, if I mention "test_foo" in the PR
# body, test_foo will be rated 1.  If I mention #123 in the PR body, and #123
# mentions "test_foo", test_foo will be rated 1.
