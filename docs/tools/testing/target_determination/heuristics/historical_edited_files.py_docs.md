# This heuristic assumes that changed files in previous commits are good sources
# of information for what files are related to each other. If fileA and
# testFileA were edited in the same commit on main, that probably means that
# future commits that change fileA should probably run testFileA. Based on this,
# a correlation dict is built based on what files were edited in commits on main.
