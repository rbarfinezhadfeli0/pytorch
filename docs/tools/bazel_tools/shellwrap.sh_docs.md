## Original Source

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# This script is helpful in entering an interactive shell from a bazel build
# before running a given bazel executable.
# This can provide a quick way to explore the sandbox directory and filesystem.
# Typical use is with
#
#     bazel run --run_under=//tools/bazel:shell_wrapper //:target
#     OR
#     bazel run --config=shell //:target
