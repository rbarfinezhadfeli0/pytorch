- **Size**: 663 bytes (0.65 KB)
- **Type**: Shell Script
- **Extension**: `.sh`

## File Purpose

This file is a **utility or tool script**.

## Original Source

```bash
# Run include-what-you-use on a file or folder
# e.g. tools/iwyu/run.sh aten/src/ATen/native/sparse/SparseBlas.cpp
# Which will print suggested changes to the console
#
# Currently the include mappings aren't good enough to trust iwyu's
# output e.g. we probably just want to include Tensor.h and trust it
# brings in the c10 headers. So, for now, use iwyu as a guide and
# update includes manually.
